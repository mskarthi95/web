With access to desired talent becoming more challenging, Talent Market Research (TMR) offers an objective view to create or support talent sourcing strategies. Corporate recruiting organizations are provided with business intelligence regarding availability of talent critical to their operations. It explores opportunities to develop new and alternative pools as well as evaluating existing sources.<br/>
 </p><br/>
 <h4>WHY TMR?</h4>
 <p>
 For corporate recruiters, “business acumen” – i.e., quickly understanding and dealing with a business situation – is usually limited to interviews and filling reqs. In order to make a larger contribution to the company, though, business acumen needs to be applied on a broader scale. Think of the major strategic initiatives that corporate recruiters support, such as new market entry and product launches, and how your insights could be used to drive a more effective outcome.
 </p><br/>
 <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
 <p>•	Custom white paper analysis of talent pools within select geographies
•	Presents comparative statistics and charts describing talent pool locations and size
•	Provides sortable data tables with hyperlinks to  information sources
•	Includes representative names research to support development of  sourcing plans
For the major strategic efforts, it isn’t enough to source candidates and scan resumes. Corporate recruiters need to identify talent pools that may be difficult to find, develop talent contingency plans and raise any issues that could derail execution of the strategy as a whole. Unlike traditional corporate recruiting tasks, entering new markets or launching new products and identifying talent requires solid market research.
The primary objectives of TMR are
•	Quantifying the talent pool in market place and hence inferring the talent sources to be targeted
•	Gaining business acumen to support a company’s strategic initiatives (Ex: new market entry and product launches)
•	Gathering market intelligence to identify issues (risk) that could derail execution of the company’s strategy (Ex: Help infer shortages in talent, specific skills and competencies in chosen geographies)
•	Penetrating findings helps suggest strategic alternatives and to derive solution to challenges in the manner of a consultant (Ex: Help locate pool of rare talent involved in niche functions)
TMR service can support the expanded role of an acumen-fueled corporate recruiter. Our research team can gather the talent market intelligence you need to inform your company’s strategic initiatives and make bold moves more likely to succeed.
